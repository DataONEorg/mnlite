    "description": "This gridded dataset consists of output from the Polar MM5, a version of the Pennsylvania State University / National Center for Atmospheric Research Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (MM5; version 2) modified for use over extensive ice sheets. More information on the Polar MM5, including a model description and validation studies, is available at  http://www-bprc.mps.ohio-state.edu.  A series of 72-h non-hydrostatic forecasts are run for a 1-y period (Jan 1993-Dec 1993) overAntarctica and the high-latitude Southern Ocean. The first 24-h of each forecast are discarded for spin up. The horizontal grid resolution is 60-km, with 120 grid points in the x and y direction. The model topography data are interpolated from a 5-km resolution digital elevation model. The ice shelves are manually identified from climatic maps, and represented as permanent ice. The vertical resolution is represented by 28 sigma levels, with the lowest at 11-m above ground level. The initial and boundary conditions include 12-hourly ECMWF TOGA (2.5 deg) global analysis for the surface and upper air variables, 6-hourly ECMWF TOGA (1.125 deg) global analysis for sea surface temperature, and daily DMSP SSM/I polar gridded sea ice concentration (25-km) from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.   Model output is in native MM5 format, and available variables are numerous, The reader is referred to the MM5 website for a complete list of variables, as well as detailed documentation and tools for reading and plotting the data. Go to the MM5 homepage at http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/mm5-home.html. This dataset is currently available upon request from the Polar Meteorology Group, Byrd Polar Research Center, Columbus, OH.
