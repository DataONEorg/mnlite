# mnonboard

This module is designed to provide a wrapper around `opersist` in order to streamline the [DataONE member node onboarding process](https://github.com/DataONEorg/mnlite/blob/feature/onboarding/docs/operation.md).
It takes as input either a json document manually edited from a template, or converts direct user input to a json document.
